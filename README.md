This code is a simple web application using HTML and JavaScript that enables audio recording through the WebRTC API. It begins by initializing variables like media_Stream, media_record, media_Track, and recorded_Chunks. The init() function orchestrates the setup process, calling start_audio() to initiate audio streaming. Event handlers are then bound to buttons, controlling functionalities like muting/unmuting, starting, pausing, resuming, and stopping the recording process. The setupMediaRecorder(stream) function configures the media recorder, managing recorded audio chunks. Upon stopping recording, the recorded chunks are combined into a Blob object, creating an audio file which is then linked for download. The HTML file contains an audio element for playback, along with buttons for user interaction, and a hidden download link. The JavaScript file links these elements, creating a functional audio recording interface.
